# SCSS Biolerplate

## Install dependencies
```
npm i
```

## Start the server and watch for changes
```
npm start
```

For `SCSS`, `JS` changes just make changes to the `source` directory. Rest everything else will be taken care by this boilerplate. All the compiled css and js files are inserted in order of their name.
